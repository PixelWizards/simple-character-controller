A simple Unity character controller

# What it is
------------------------------------------------------
The simplest way to describe this is a rework of the character controller that is available in the Unity Starter / Standard packages.

# Multiple movement modes

## Free Roam
Camera relative movement, Character rotates to face the direction that they are moving

## Targeted / Over the Shoulder
A standard over the shoulder third person shooter type movement system. Character faces in the direction the camera is aiming, 
character has 8 directional movement animation (strafe / etc) for proper directional movement.

## As well as 
- Jump
- Fall
- Walk / Run
- pre configured Cinemachine third person camera complete with camera offset, collision etc.
